# Developer Log

## [11/27/25] - Initial Setup and Looking over the project
* **Work Done**: Initialized git repo, added started files (Cmake). Created 'developer_log.md'
* **Issues**: None....I'd hope so since I haven't done anything :)
* **Files Modified**: developer_log.md

## [11/28/2025] - Initial Work in tree.h
* **Work Done**: Initial Attempt at the structure and code of all the methods in tree.h
* **Issues**: None detected, but Haven't fully integrated proper testing yet. Did have some funny errors for confusing inline and outline in adding in the methods....I was tired after work and was not thinking for a bit....
* **Files Modified**: developer_log.md, tree.h
